        'excerpt' => "Hot chicken is indisputably Nashville's iconic food: simple in concept, its aggressive flavor isn't one you'll soon forget. Hot chicken takes something unassailably Southern, heavy, and indulgent—I'm talking regular fried chicken—and makes that dish seem like sissy food. Nashville's take puts the hurt on—it's fried chicken reborn with a fiery spirit, sweet-mean, as if the contents of Granny's picnic basket were somehow crossed with a young Mick Jagger."

        'excerpt' => "These days hot chicken seems to be synonymous with Nashville. And while it’s nearly impossible to hear about Music City without the mention of the now internationally famous dish, it’s with good reason. Locals and tourists alike flock to their favorite heat slingers, whether it be where the fiery bird made its debut over 70 years ago, or to one of the handful of new hot chicken joints that are putting their own spins on the classic. And while many restaurants have added a hot (fill in the blank) dish to their menus, these spots have a special focus on it."

        'excerpt' => "Nashville is the home of hot chicken — fried chicken that’s breaded with spices to give it a little extra kick. While KFC tried to bring it to the masses in recent years, the best version of hot chicken comes from the country music capital of the United States. There’s a debate as to who cooks up the best hot chicken in town between Prince’s Hot Chicken Shack and Hattie B’s Hot Chicken, but whose is really the best?"
